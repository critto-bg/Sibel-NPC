@2800 = ~Ah, the remnants of the Arcanis family have decided to pay a visit. How sensational!~
@2801 = ~At least you do not claim me to be a part of yours, creature.~
@2802 = ~You were the one who refused my offer! Now you find out what an unwise decision that was.~
@2803 = ~Drop your pretence, Lawrence! The bonds of family are meaningless to you. Do your cousins think you care about them?~
@2804 = ~Do they even know of your plan to sacrifice their so-called lives? Do these wretches realise that their demise will complete your transformation?~
@2805 = ~Go on then. Scuttle away, a coward that you are.~
@2806 = ~Cease your lies. You will not tear us apart with those deceptive words. Prepare to meet your demise, wizard.~
@2807 = ~I shall fetch the undertakers to prepare the funeral for you and your dearest sibling.~
@2808 = ~We shall see.~
