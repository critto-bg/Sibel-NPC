@2000 = ~Hey, friend. Are you looking to sell some leather?~
@2001 = ~Hello. Why do you ask? Are you willing to buy?~
@2002 = ~Not at the moment, no. I'll be going.~
@2003 = ~Me? No, friend, I'm just an intermediary. I may introduce you to someone who does, though, for a modest commission of ten Arcanis coins.~
@2004 = ~This is a steep price you're asking. I'm willing to take the risk. Put me in touch with her.~
@2005 = ~It's a great deal of coin. I will have to think about it.~
@2006 = ~You've made a good choice. I will tell her to meet you in the main square. Don't be late. Nice doing business with you, friend.~
@2007 = ~Suit yourself.~
